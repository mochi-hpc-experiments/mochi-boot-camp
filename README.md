## Food

Coffee/beverage/snack service will be available when the meeting
starts and will be refreshed in the afternoon.  For lunch we will
probably walk to the on-site cafeteria, which has a variety of
food options

# System access for hands-on development

We will be using systems in the [Joint Laboratory for System Evaluation
(JLSE)](http://jlse.anl.gov) at ANL for all boot camp experiments. You can
find documentation for logging into the JLSE environment and running code
there as part of [Session 2: Hands-on](sessions/s2-hands-on/README.md).

# Session materials

Note that you can clone this repository to get a copy of slides, reference
materials, etc. contained within it. Doing `git clone --recurse-submodules https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/sds/mochi-boot-camp.git`
will also give you the documentation for Margo, Thallium, Mercury, and ABT-IO, in the `mochi-doc` folder. This documentation
also contains source code for all the examples.
