## Meeting logistics

* Thursday Feb. 6, 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM
* TODO: Where?

### Communication

TODO: do we need a mailing list for attendees here? Slack? We have these setup
already for the ANL bootcamp, but unclear how to repurpose them...

# System access for hands-on development

TODO: pointers to system-specific information useful to users, depending on feedback from attendees

# Session materials

Note that you can clone this repository to get a copy of slides, reference
materials, etc. contained within it. Doing `git clone --recurse-submodules https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/sds/mochi-boot-camp.git`
will also give you the documentation for Margo, Thallium, Mercury, and ABT-IO, in the `mochi-doc` folder. This documentation
also contains source code for all the examples.
